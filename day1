Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, 
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Constraints
n == nums.length 1 <= n <= 300 nums[i] is 0, 1, or 2
Output Format
001122

Solution:

x=input()
y=""
for i in range (0,3):
    b=str(i)
    a=x.count(b)
    for j in range (0,a)
         y+=str(i)
print(y)
